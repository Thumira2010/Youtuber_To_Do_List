Created with CodeSandbox.
Use this link to check the website : https://n84gpz.csb.app/  .
This is a platform for a youtuber that can make a notes about his channel videos.In here you can add notes as well as delete notes.There are 3 categories in the note HEADING , CONTENT , AUTHOR.I added the Athor feature incase the channel has more members, they all can share there notes.This is fully created with React JS . This can be much developed by using POSTGRES SQL. 

In the Header:
 You can hover on the Channel name and click the link & it will link to your channel.

In the Body:
=> You can make notes and delete notes

In the Footer:
=> The year is dynamically represented by the function of "GetFullYear()". 
=> If you have socials you can also link to them.For now I only used Youtube( Bootstrap Icons ).
